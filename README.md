## ðŸ§  Reflection

Throughout CS-320, Iâ€™ve deepened my understanding of software testing, automation, and quality assurance by developing and refining the Contact Service application and completing a comprehensive summary and reflections report. These artifacts demonstrate my ability to write functional, secure code and apply rigorous testing strategies to meet project requirements.

To ensure my code is both functional and secure, I rely on a combination of unit testing, input validation, and thoughtful design. I use JUnit to automate test coverage and uncover edge cases, and I follow best practices for encapsulation and exception handling to prevent vulnerabilities. I also document my code thoroughly and include author tags and comments to support maintainability and academic integrity.

Interpreting user needs begins with analyzing the project requirements and identifying core functionality. I break down each requirement into testable components and design my classes and methods to reflect real-world use cases. For example, the `ContactService` class was built to manage contact records reliably, with constraints that mirror practical data validation scenarios.

When designing software, I take a methodical, modular approach. I start by mapping out the class structure and responsibilities, then build incrementally with frequent testing and feedback integration. I prioritize clarity, logical flow, and audience-aware documentationâ€”especially when preparing submissions for academic review or future employers.

Together, these projects have helped me build professional habits in software testing and documentation. Theyâ€™ve also reinforced the importance of reflection as a tool for growth. By revisiting my work and articulating my process, Iâ€™m better prepared to showcase my skills and continue improving as a developer.
